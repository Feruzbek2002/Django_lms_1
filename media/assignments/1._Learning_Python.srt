1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,750
Now let's get started shall we.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:11,240
In order for any programmer to learn a language there are four key things that you need to really master

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,870
for any sort of language including python.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,830
First are the terms of that language.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,640
Sometimes a programming language has different awards and different definitions for these words that

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:35,330
you're going to have to memorize things like statements variables instantiation really complicated sounding

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,700
words but you need to understand what they mean so that you can talk to other programmers.

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:51,050
You also need to learn about a languages data type that is what sort of data can a program hold.

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,080
You can think of it as a values just like in real life.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,090
We have different ways to represent values like numbers letters and symbols.

11
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:07,140
In programming we have these data types to store information and each programming language has different

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,060
sort of data types.

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,040
Next we need to learn about actions.

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:20,040
At the end of the day all programming is is a way for us to tell our machines Hey store this data and

15
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,640
then retrieve this data and perform some action on it.

16
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,050
That's all it is just using memory and performing some actions.

17
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:35,100
So we're going to learn how to perform those actions and then finally we have to learn the best practices

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,770
of each language.

19
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:42,840
There's good ways of writing Python code and then there's bad ways so that when we build our applications

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,770
our programs while we don't have a leaning tower like this but we have a solid structure and a solid

21
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,700
program.

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,610
So throughout the course we're going to learn about these things but keep this in mind.

23
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,230
These four things are why you need to become a good programmer and I want to start the basic Python

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,840
section with the data types.

25
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,770
So let's get started.
